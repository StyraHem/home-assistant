This platform adds components for Shelly smart home devices to Home Assistant. There is no configuration needed, it will find all devices on your LAN and add them to Home Assistant.

## Installation

### (not working yet) Install with Custom Updater

Do you you have [Custom updater](https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater) installed? Then you can use the service [custom_updater.install](https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater/wiki/Services#install-element-cardcomponentpython_script) with the parameter {"element":"shelly"} to install Shelly.

### Install manually

1. Install this platform by creating a `custom_components` folder in the same folder as your configuration.yaml, if it doesn't already exist.
2. Create another folder `shelly` in the `custom_components` folder. Copy all 5 Python (.py) files into the `shelly` folder. Use `raw version` if you copy and paste the files from the browser.

## Configure

When you have installed shelly and make sure it exists under `custom_components` folder it is time to configure it in Home Assistant.

It is very easy, just add `shelly` this to your `configuration.yaml`

### Examples

```yaml
shelly:
```

#### Without discovery - manually specify devices

```yaml
shelly:
  discovery: false
  version: true #add version sensor
  devices:      #devices to be added
    - id: 420FC7
    - id: 13498B-1   #Shelly 2, Id + Channel number
    - id: 7BD5F3
      name: My cool plug   #set friendly name
```

#### With discovery - adjust some devices

```yaml
shelly:
  discovery: true  #add all devices (default)
  devices:  #configure devices
    - id: 420FC7
      light_switch: true  #add this switch as a light
    - id: 7BD5F3
      name: My cool plug #set friendly name
```

If you disable discovery only Shellies under devices will be added.

You can only specify one username and password for restrict login. If you enter username and password, access to devices without restrict login will continue to work. Different logins to different deveces will be added later.

## Restart Home Assistant

Now you should restart Home Assistant to load shelly

Shelly will discover all devices on your LAN and show them as light, switch, sensor and cover in Home Assistant.
